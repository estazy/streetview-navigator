# Street View Navigator

Welcome to Street View Navigator! This application allows users to plan a route between two locations and then virtually 'drive' through it using Google Street View. It provides a unique way to explore and familiarize yourself with a journey before you take it. The app also features route narratives generated by Gemini and turn-by-turn directions synchronized with the Street View.

## Features

*   **Route Planning**: Enter start and end locations to calculate a driving route.
*   **Street View Simulation**: "Ride" along the calculated route with Street View panoramas.
*   **Interactive 2D Map**: View the route on a 2D map that synchronizes with the Street View, and click to jump to specific points.
*   **Adjustable Simulation**: Control playback speed and the "step distance" (granularity) of the Street View movement.
*   **Route Narrative by Gemini**: Get an engaging, descriptive overview of your journey generated by Google's Gemini API.
*   **Turn-by-Turn Directions**: See Google Maps turn-by-turn instructions, highlighted as you progress.
*   **Multilingual UI**: Supports English and Thai.
*   **Geolocation**: Optionally uses your current location as a default starting point.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 19 (using esm.sh for CDN delivery), TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
*   **Mapping & Street View**: Google Maps JavaScript API
*   **AI Narrative**: Google Gemini API (via `@google/genai` SDK)
*   **Module Management**: ES Modules with Import Maps in `index.html`

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
*   A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code).
*   A simple local HTTP server to serve the files (since ES modules are used). Python's built-in server or Node.js `http-server` are good options.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download the files)**
    If this were a Git repository, you'd clone it. For now, ensure you have all the provided files in a single project directory.

2.  **Configure Google Maps API Key**

    *   Open `index.html`.
    *   Find the line that includes the Google Maps API script:
        ```html
        <script async src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE&libraries=routes,streetView,geometry,places"></script>
        ```
    *   Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google Maps API key.
    *   **Important**: For this key to work, you must enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud Console project:
        *   **Maps JavaScript API**
        *   **Directions API**
        *   **Street View API**
        *   **Geocoding API**
        *   **Places API**
    *   It is highly recommended to restrict your API key in the Google Cloud Console.

3.  **Configure Gemini API Key (Optional)**

    The Gemini API is used for generating route narratives. If you wish to use this feature:
    *   Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory (the same directory as `package.json`).
    *   Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `your_actual_gemini_api_key_here` with your key:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
        ```
    *   **Important for security:** If you are using Git, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent your API key from being committed to version control. Create a `.gitignore` file in the project root if it doesn't exist and add the line:
        ```
        .env
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install` or `pnpm install` if you prefer those package managers).

5.  **Run the Application Locally**
    After installing dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server. It will typically open the application in your default web browser at a URL like `http://localhost:5173`. If it doesn't open automatically, the terminal output will show you the URL to open.

## How to Enable Google Cloud Dependency Services

To ensure the Google Maps API features work correctly, you need to enable specific services in the Google Cloud Console for the project associated with your API key:

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Select your project.
3.  In the navigation menu (hamburger icon ☰), go to **"APIs & Services" > "Library"**.
4.  Search for and **ENABLE** each of the following APIs:
    *   **Maps JavaScript API**
    *   **Directions API**
    *   **Street View API** (ensure it's the one that supports `StreetViewService` for dynamic panoramas, sometimes listed under a broader Maps SDK)
    *   **Geocoding API**
    *   **Places API**
5.  Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate after enabling.

## Building for Production (Optional)

If you want to create an optimized build of the application, you can run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready static assets. You can then preview this build locally using:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project:

1.  **Fork the repository** (if this were on a platform like GitHub). For now, make a copy of the codebase.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
3.  **Make your changes**. Ensure your code follows the existing style and structure.
4.  **Test your changes thoroughly**.
5.  **Submit a pull request** (if applicable) with a clear description of your changes.

## Potential Future Enhancements

*   Save/Load routes.
*   More detailed Street View controls (e.g., look around).
*   Error handling for more specific API error codes.
*   More sophisticated Gemini prompt engineering for varied narratives.
*   Using a proper bundler (like Vite or Webpack) for optimized builds and easier dependency management if the project grows.
